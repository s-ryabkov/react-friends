Create a WEB app
1. Login
a) As a first time user I want to see login screen, enter mail & password. Press login. Then see Friends page.
b) When Reopen the page, and logged in previously
Then see Friends page.

2. Friends page
a) When logged and on "Friends"  page I should see table with 5 columns:Name, Last Name, age, gender, birth date.
b) I should have simple table paging implemented for table to load additional 5 friends.
c) I should have simple table filters to show friends with age and gender for existing data on a client.
d) add Filter to search all friends by name from backend

Display with basic Bootstrap style, no customisation needed.Use React components, Redux for state handlingCreate node App

Node app should have express.js or similar to consume Rest API calls.
1) provide a back point for login.
Don't setup any Database, create stub data - return random user id, token etc.
Any credential data should work fine - simple REST, don't provide JWT checks.
2) Provide a back point which will accept "friends" to load for authenticated user - just provide random user data (token), nothing complicated
3) Create a method to create friend data (about 50 fake friends  in JSON or via function ) - no actual names needed. Names like "Friend 1" are fine.

NOTES
Create GitHub public repository for this task.
Commit and push changes frequently for us to observe work.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
Please don't use extensive starter projects, use simple React starter.
Provide minimal code. If you DO use huge starter projects at this point, provide file names that you created in Readme.md, it will help (speed up) code review.
Also provide initial build steps for project, e.g:
 1)yarn install
 2)yarn run start
Make sure that project starts with fresh 'npm install' and major functionality can be tested.
Leave notes if something wasn't completed or doesn't work properly.
